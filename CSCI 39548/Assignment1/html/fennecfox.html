        The Fennec Fox is a small nocturnal fox found in the Sahara Desert. It has distinctive large ears 
        which help to dissipate heat and locate prey. These foxes are adapted to life in the desert and are 
        able to survive without drinking water for long periods of time. In addition, Fennec Foxes are known 
        for their playful and curious nature.
