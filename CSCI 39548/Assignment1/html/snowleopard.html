        Snow Leopards are a large, elusive cat species that are native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. 
        They have a beautiful, thick fur coat that helps them survive in cold environments, and powerful legs that 
        allow them to climb and leap over rugged terrain. Snow Leopards are skilled hunters, able to take down prey 
        much larger than themselves, and are considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and poaching.
