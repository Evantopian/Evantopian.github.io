        Glaucus atlanticus, also known as the blue sea slug or blue dragon, is a small species of sea slug 
        found in the oceans worldwide. Its vibrant blue coloration and unique anatomy make it one of the 
        most fascinating creatures in the sea.These slugs are unique predators, as they have the ability to 
        feed on venomous jellyfish and store their venom to use as a defense mechanism against their own predators.
