        Pandas are large, black-and-white bears that are native to China. They are known for their distinctive appearance, 
        including their round faces, fuzzy ears, and cute waddling gait. Pandas are classified as a vulnerable species due 
        to habitat loss, and conservation efforts have focused on breeding programs and habitat restoration.
