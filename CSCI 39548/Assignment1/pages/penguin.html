        Penguins are flightless birds that are highly adapted to living in cold environments, such as the Antarctic. 
        They have a streamlined body shape, flipper-like wings, and waterproof feathers that allow them to swim and dive for food in the ocean. 
        Penguins are also known for their distinctive waddling walk on land and their cute, tuxedo-like appearance.
